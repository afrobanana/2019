They jumped in at the last minute and we couldn’t be happier – introducing The Mauskovic Dance Band, Afro Banana Republic Festival’s brand-new headliner. The brainchild of the
Amsterdam-based producer and musician Nicola Mauskovic, this all round funky fivesome will be pounding the World Stage with their unique blend of Afro-Colombian rhythm, Afro-Disco and No-Wave sounds and even some electronic beats. The groove is uniquely hypnotic and is guaranteed to get you on your feet.
