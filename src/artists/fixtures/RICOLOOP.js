Mind challenging, inspiring, visually stimulatingâ€¦ oh yes! Rico Diessner - A.K.A. Ricoloop is profoundly inhabited by a desire to catch the invisible, to plant a flower on the moon. Ricoloop is descending on our shores to stimulate audiences with his live producing and recording with a loopstation. Using a guitar and bass, harmonica, piano and melodica, singing and beatboxing - you name it, boundless creativity will be pouring out of Ricoloop!
