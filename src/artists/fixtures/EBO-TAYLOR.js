Ghanaian legend, Ebo Taylor, and his Saltpond City Band are gearing up to spread joy and great vibes as ABR Festival headliners! One of the fathers of highlife and afrobeat, and inspirer of many talents including the young Fela Kuti in the 60s, the 82-year-old has a smile you just can’t rub off his face and the outstanding energy of a 20-year-old. Expect the always playful guitarist-singer-bandleader-producer to cross his signature highlife and afrobeat rhythms with heated up funk and jazz, accentuated by heaps of infectious energy. All you need to do…is dance like there’s no tomorrow.
