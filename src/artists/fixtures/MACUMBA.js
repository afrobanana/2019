Giorgos Morfitis, Elias Ioannou and Rodos Panagiotou meet Rodrigo Cáceres from Chile, to bring you an explosive - and rather addictive blend of Brazilian samba, rumba and guaguancó afro-Cuban rhythms blended with some great jazz. Enthusiastically received by live audiences in Cyprus, Macumba presents original compositions exploring the diversity of Latin, jazz &amp; world music. Prepare for an unforgettable journey!
