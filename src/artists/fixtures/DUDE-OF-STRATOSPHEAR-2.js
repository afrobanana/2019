The DUDE is returning back to the ABR Festival again this year! And he will have you grooving and moving in ways beyond your wildest imagination, spinning an eclectic mixture of underground sounds from around the world, leftfield electronic and experimental dance music. Jetting in for the festival from Geneva, it’s all about crazy vintage sounds and obscure grooves from Asia and beyond. Collecting records and DJing for over 20 years, he has been a resident DJ at various venues in Geneva such as the Madone Bar, Shark, L’Etage and promoter at Zoo-Usine, where he focused on art performance and experimental music. After countless trips to the Far East, he has sharpened his globe-spanning mix with far eastern psychedelic music and largely unheard gems from across the musical spectrum.
