With fifteen years of experience in DJ-ing and party-making, Chevy is considered a local hero in his hometown, Athens, Greece. Not only has he played and cooperated with the most important local artists and countless international acts, both in Athens and all over Greece, but he is also a resident DJ at six d.o.g.s; the Athenian underground place-to-be! Jetting to Cyprus for the ABR Festival, party-goers can expect tantalizing electronic disco, electro and left-field house.
