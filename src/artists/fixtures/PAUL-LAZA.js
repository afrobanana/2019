Musically born and raised in the underground scene of the Venice suburbs, Paul Lazaâ€™s unique style mixes the motley assortment of influences that shaped his life from an early age. And when he hits the ABR Festival stage, he&#39;ll be building a strong connection to the crowd, spreading the love much like he does at countless big events, festivals and underground parties around Italy, Portugal, Israel and beyond with afrobeat and salsa, disco, hip hop, Italo-disco and all sorts of electronic music (Chicago, Detroit, NYC, house and Techno). Active in the social environmental fields, Paul also promotes sensitive issues through his music and events. His WOOD label, founded in 2013, aims at developing the suburb area around Venice and supporting underground music and street art with sustainability and respect for nature as reference point.
