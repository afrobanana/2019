A 4-piece percussion driven electronic quartet, Penya will be adding a touch of tribal mysticism to the festival experience, led by producer and multi-instrumentalist Magnus PI! Penyaâ€™s wanderings will be transporting you through Cuba, Turkey, Morocco, Peru, Tanzania, India and beyond, with spiritual samba, songs that touch on ancient Afro-Cuban melodies and wide-open groove escapes that draw on percussionist, Jim Le Ms experiences as a ceremonial Bata drummer.
