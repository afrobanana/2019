      <dt>MEDICAL HELP & EMERGENCIES</dt>
      <dd>
        A team of professional medics will be on-site 24/7 throughout the event,
        always on hand to provide first aid and medical assistance in case of
        emergencies. If help is needed, please contact your nearest security
        guard or member of the AfroBanana team.

      <dt>FIRE SAFETY</dt>
      <dd>
        Cyprus gets very hot and very dry in the summer month, so we take fire
        safety at AfroBanana Festival very seriously. Fires spread quickly, and
        easily so lighting them is strictly forbidden anywhere on site. You’re
        here to party, not burn the whole place to the ground! Stay aware and if
        there’s one rule you stick to, make it this one!
      </dd>

      <dt>CLEANLINESS & RECYCLING</dt>
      <dd>
        Thanks to your support, we have managed to reduce overall waste by a
        third per person over the past few years. But we want to continue
        improving and we need your help. We’ve arranged for a spot of
        post-festival recycling, so please respect your beautiful surroundings
        rather than leaving your mark, and separate your rubbish, taking any
        non-recyclables away when you leave. .{' '}
      </dd>

      <dt>LITTER & DESIGNATED BINS</dt>
      <dd>
        When the madness is over, we want to leave the site as beautiful as it
        was when we got there, so designated on-site bins will be located across
        the festival grounds, with clear labels for rubbish separation. Please
        be mindful and use them! And smokers, please do not chuck your butts on
        the floor and more importantly the beach. The sea is home to many
        creatures who don’t want your butts (or any other rubbish the waves
        carried out) for dinner. Karma will be watching you!

      <dt>DRINKING WITHOUT WASTE</dt>
      <dd>
        In an effort to minimize waste, our amazing eco cups made of recyclable
        plastic are back for 2018 and in celebration of their return, we have a
        fun fact for you: Since we successfully launched the re-usable cup
        system two years ago, we’ve saved over 20,000 plastic cups that would
        have otherwise ended up in a landfill. Cool right! So, keep supporting
        the cause and pick up your collectable 2018 cup at the festival this
        year for just 1 euro.

      <dt>RENEWABLE ENERGY</dt>
      <dd>
        Our dedicated renewable energy team will be rebuilding our recharging
        dome and bicycle generator again this year, so that you can keep your
        phone juiced all festival long. You know the drill by now… Step 1: Get
        on the bicycle; Step 2: Start giving it some of your very best pedal
        power; Step 3: Plug your phone into the charging cable, and Step 4: Call
        your friends to come chill out inside the Dome, while you work!

      <dt>WIND TURBINES</dt>
      <dd>
        To make the most of our brand new beachside location, our ABR architects
        and power engineers put their heads together and built a custom-made a
        device that uses the wind to generate power. Looking more like an
        intriguing piece of art that rotates with the air flow, the sculptural
        wind turbine device will power the kid’s innovation workshops, in the
        hopes of engaging and inspiring young people to make positive
        environmental changes.

      <dt>WHAT WE ARE HOPING TO ACHIEVE THIS YEAR:</dt>
      <dd>
        <ol>
          <li>
            To become the island’s first straw free festival – no straws will be
            available
          </li>
          <li>To power an entire stage by wind power</li>
          <li>
            To be plastic packaging free – no food vendors will be using plastic
            food packaging and rumour has it that some are challenging the idea
            of packaging at all.
