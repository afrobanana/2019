This year our festival radio will be curated by our dear friends over at the Brandy Sour collective. They’ll be inviting their favourite local DJ’s to share two-hour sets which will be combined with interviews from the other friends of the festival. And listen up for the Open Deck session which will be activated on Saturday afternoon.
