It’s not often in Cyprus that we get the opportunity to see or hear such a unique percussion instrument up close and personal. So, grab the chance while you can and get acquainted with the rich and dreamlike sounds of the Marimba at an exclusive concert organised just for AfroBanana festivalgoers of all ages. But what is a Marimba we hear you ask? Think large scale xylophone made of wooden bars which are hit with mallets to produce notes – for more information come and see for yourselves!
