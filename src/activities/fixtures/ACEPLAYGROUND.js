You heard the big news, right? AfroBanana Festival is moving to the beach! So, this year, the event is hosting the cool beach “bums” down at Ace Playgrounds! Passionate about the free-spirited nature of beach racket these dudes organise popular pop-up beach racket playgrounds at beautiful beach locations around the island; and for one epic weekend in July, they’ll be hitting the sand, inspiring AfroBananians to get active, develop their skills and learn new tricks, through collaborative games, in a fun and vibrant environment. We’ve also partnered up with our friends at Ace Playgrounds to produce a unique Limited-Edition Beach Racket, so, grab your new gear, a hat and some sun screen and join in the festival beach vibes right by the sea! 

**Capacity:** 12 participants

**Duration:** No time limit! The playground will be active from morning to sunset.

**Age Group:**  Children aged 10 - adulthood
