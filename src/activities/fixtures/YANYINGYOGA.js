The practice of Yang & Yin Yoga helps us to learn about stillness in movement and movement in stillness. In this highly-grounding yet energising session, yogi of all levels will tune into their inner strength, flexibility and stamina as they rise up and connect with the Yang elements; before aligning with the Yang elements to cool down, connect with the earth, stimulate the meridians, balance the inner organs and improve joint mobility. Working deeply on the connective tissues to release tension in the body, you will also learn to silence and calm the mind by synchronizing movement with breath.
