Let’s take a trip to the beach! During this interactive yoga workshop, children will explore all the fun ways that we can use our bodies to mimic the shapes, movements and behaviours of the sea creatures that live beneath the waves. Introducing mini yogi’s-in-the-making to salutations, breathing techniques and yogic games, this expertly led workshop is equal parts energy and fun; and equal parts relaxation, all in a safe, non-competitive environment where your little ones can thrive!
